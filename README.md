# PHP Web Interface App

This is a simple PHP application that runs on a local XAMPP server. It provides a browser-based interface for performing various operations. The main script file is `web_interface_src_code.php`.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.

1. Copy the `web_interface_src_code.php` file into the `htdocs` folder inside your XAMPP installation directory.
2. Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the **Apache** server.
3. In your browser, go to:  
   `http://localhost/web_interface_src_code.php`
4. The application will start and display a web interface.
5. You can perform all operations through the web interface.

## Notes

- Make sure XAMPP is installed and properly configured.
- Ensure no other services are using **port 80** (commonly Skype, IIS, or Docker).
- If your PHP file is renamed or placed in a subdirectory, modify the URL accordingly:
    http://localhost/foldername/yourfilename.php
- If the application includes database functionality, make sure:
  - MySQL is running
  - Database credentials are correctly configured (usually in a `db.php` or inside the same file)
